# BDGE-Start-Up-ADPr
R Shiny app for BDGE start up ADP data

## Installation

Local version can be run via R.  If you're unfamiliar with R, it is a statistical language that is freely available.  R is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).  Once you download R, cut and paste the following code (you will only have to run this code __ONE__ time only):

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

Once the shiny library is installed, you can run the app directly from Github using the following code:

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("ACNC-DAME", "bdpiccolo")
```

I will be updating the mock drafts periodically.
